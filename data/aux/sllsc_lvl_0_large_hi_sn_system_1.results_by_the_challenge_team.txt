# team name: The Challenge Team
# team members: Stefan Hilbert, Massimo Meneghetti , Dandan Xu
# contact email: hilbert@mpa-garching.mpg.de
#
# comments:
# - Submissions of results should follow the provided format and naming conventions. Teams may submit different entries for different methods.
#
# - For submission of detailed results for a simulated system with files named
#   "sllsc_lvl_0_some_system.info.txt", etc.
#   the submitted file should be named like
#   "sllsc_lvl_0_some_system.results_by_team_name_and_possibly_method.txt".
# 
# - The file should contain a header section and a parameter results section.
#
# - All lines except those stating the parameter results in the format provided below should start with "#" or be empty.
#
# - Please include in the file header the names of all team members, and at least one email address for communication and feedback.
#
# - In the parameter results section, please provide your estimates of parameters as the mean and standard deviation of your Gaussian approximations to your marginalized parameter posteriors.
#
# - Please send your results to:
#   hilbert@mpa-garching.mpg.de
