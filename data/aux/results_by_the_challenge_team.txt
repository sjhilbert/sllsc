# sllsc summary results submission file example for challenge level 0 and 1
#
# header:
#
# team name: The Challenge Team
# team members: Stefan Hilbert, Massimo Meneghetti , Dandan Xu
# contact email: hilbert@mpa-garching.mpg.de
#
# comments:
# - Submissions of results should follow the provided format and naming conventions. Teams may submit different entries for different methods.
#
# - For submission of summary results a single file containing results for all systems should be named like
#   "results_by_team_name_and_possibly_method.txt".
# 
# - The file should contain a header section and a parameter results section.
#
# - All lines except those stating the parameter results in the format provided below should start with "#" or be empty.
#
# - Please include in the file header the names of all team members, and at least one email address for communication and feedback.
#
# - In the parameter results section, please provide your estimates of substructure parameters as the mean and standard deviation of your Gaussian approximations to your marginalized parameter posteriors.
#
# - Please send your results to:
#   hilbert@mpa-garching.mpg.de
