Strong Lens Line-of-sight and Substructure Challenge

Welcome to our challenge to detect and quantify line-of-sight structures and substructure in galaxy-galaxy strong lenses!

The challenge is divided into four levels of increasing difficulty, complexity, and/or realism from level 0 (simple source,
simple main lens mass, single substructure, simple instrument without noise, all parameters known) to level 3 (complex source, complex main lens, multiple l.o.s. structures and substructures, realistic instruments).

The **challenge design** is described in more detail here:
- [sllsc_design.pdf](https://github.com/sjhilbert/sllsc/blob/master/doc/sllsc_design/sllsc_design.pdf)

The **simulated data** for the first two levels (sorry radio data still missing) can be found here:
- [lvl_0.tar.gz](https://github.com/sjhilbert/sllsc/raw/master/data/lvl_0.tar.gz)
- [lvl_1.tar.gz](https://github.com/sjhilbert/sllsc/raw/master/data/lvl_1.tar.gz)

But probably the easiest way to get the simulated data is probably to just clone or download this project:

Please submit your results as described in the example submission file:
- t.b.d.
