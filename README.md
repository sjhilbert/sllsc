Welcome to our challenge to detect and quantify line-of-sight structures and substructure in galaxy-galaxy strong lenses!

The challenge is divided into four levels of increasing difficulty, complexity, and/or realism from level 0 (simple source,
simple main lens mass, single substructure, simple instrument without noise, all parameters known) to level 3 (complex source, complex main lens, multiple l.o.s. structures and substructures, realistic instruments).

The **challenge design** is described in more detail here:
- [sllsc_design.pdf](https://sjhilbert.github.io/sllsc/doc/sllsc_design/sllsc_design.pdf)

The **simulated data** for the first two levels (sorry radio data still missing) can be found here:
- [lvl_0.tar.gz](https://sjhilbert.github.io/sllsc/data/lvl_0.tar.gz)
- [lvl_1.tar.gz](https://sjhilbert.github.io/sllsc/data/lvl_1.tar.gz)

But probably the easiest way to get the simulated data is probably to just **clone** or **download** this project:
- [https://github.com/sjhilbert/sllsc](https://github.com/sjhilbert/sllsc)

Please **submit your results** for the first two levels as described in the example submission files:
- a single [file](https://sjhilbert.github.io/sllsc/data/aux/results_by_the_challenge_team.txt) (per team and method) containing results for substructure paramaters of all systems
- for more detailed feedback, a [file](https://sjhilbert.github.io/sllsc/data/aux/sllsc_lvl_0_large_hi_sn_system_1.results_by_the_challenge_team.txt) for each system containing results of source, main lens, and substructure parameters
